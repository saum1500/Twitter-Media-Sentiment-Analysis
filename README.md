# Twitter Media Sentiment Analysis (BLACK LIVES MATTER)
This project is meant to identify and quantify the bias in media representation if there is any. I collected the tweets from the thirty most followed news media bodies on twitter containing a list of words surrounding a political issue for analysis. The code is reusable but this analysis has been done on the Black lives matter movement.
